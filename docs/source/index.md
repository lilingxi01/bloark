# Blocks Architecture (BloArk)

**Blocks Architecture** (as known as **BloArk**) is a powerful Python package designed to process the extensive edit history of Wikipedia pages into easily manageable and memory-friendly blocks. The package is specifically developed to enable efficient parallelization and composition of these blocks to facilitate faster processing and analysis of large Wikipedia datasets in industries and researches. The initial intuition of BloArk is to build other Wikipedia-oriented datasets on top of it.
